# UserDataSave

My first program after studying the structured "Backend Developer" map on the website https://roadmap.sh/
You can see the material I studied at this link: https://roadmap.sh/u/psnx

About the program:
This program using the Windows console is designed to: 
1. Create files with data that will be located in the root folder of the program. 
2. Viewing data from created files 
3. Changing data from files 
4. Deleting data files
